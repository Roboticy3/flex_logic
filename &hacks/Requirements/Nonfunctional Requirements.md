1. The library should not be too platform dependent, and at least theoretically usable in systems besides my game.
2. The library's dependencies must be open source or otherwise free to integrate, since I can't afford to license at that level.
3. The file formats saved by the tool should be at least as readable as those produced by dependencies.
4. Generated circuits should be [[Synthesizable]]
5. The goal of accurate simulation is to give any games made using the library higher educational value. It's hard to implement simulations to include things like timing bugs, and they can be confusing for players, but mastering them is really satisfying when learning about computer architecture and well worthwhile.
