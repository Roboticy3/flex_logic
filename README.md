# Flex Logic
This is a working specification for a digital logic simulator meant to operate on audio in the Godot game engine. Before I was sure of what technologies I wanted to use to approach this problem, this repo served as a spot to experiment with different approaches. 

I have since grown out of this repo, and I'm not planning on supporting it further. If you're looking for a digital logic simulation library in Godot, please refer to https://www.github.com/Roboticy3/flex_logic_cpp_2.

If this repo sees more life, it will probably be as a place for documentation on the active implementation I'm working on.
