Starting on the main world screen, zoom into the first world and solve the not level. This should only take like 15 seconds. But then, zoom out, zoom into the mouth of the cat, and steal a boombox from some transistors. The boombox can then be plugged into the input of the not level. In volume based levels, plugging in a boombox will multiply the input, as opposed to setting it in sample based levels.

This adds a design element of boomboxes. They serve as an earlier, weaker link between the transistors and the levels, showing the games real bread and butter quickly.
